_In this section, Professors Mark Bathe and Jeff Gore share advice with other educators about using the materials published on the OCW course site._

{{< quote "We hope instructors feel free to mix and match the discussion topics and the faculty presentation slides to suit their own teaching objectives." "â€” Mark Bathe and Jeff Gore" >}}

The research topics and papers shared on our OCW course site cover a wide range of topics and are quite advanced. It can be challenging to communicate this content effectively to groups of students who may have very different background knowledge and experience levels. We hope educators do not see that as a barrier to using these course materials. Rather, we hope instructors feel free to mix and match the discussion topics and the faculty presentation slides to suit their own teaching objectives.

It is important to note that each module is independent of the others. An educator could present the modules in a different order than the one we have presented, or even present only subsets of the modules, and they would still be able to provide rich learning experiences for their students. Educators should feel empowered to use these materials to teach in whatever was they think will most benefit their students.
