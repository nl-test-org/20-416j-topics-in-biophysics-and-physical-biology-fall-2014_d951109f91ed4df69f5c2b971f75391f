Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _20.416J Topics in Biophysics and Physical Biology_ as it was taught by Professors Mark Bathe and Jeff Gore in Fall 2014.

This course provides broad exposure to research in biophysics and physical biology, with emphasis on the critical evaluation of scientific literature. Weekly meetings include in-depth discussion of scientific literature led by various MIT faculty on active research topics. Each session also includes a brief discussion of non-research topics including effective presentation skills, writing papers and fellowship proposals, choosing scientific and technical research topics, time management, and scientific ethics.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Meet the interdisciplinary faculty at MIT who research biophysics and physical biology
*   Learn about important topics in the fields of biophysics and physical biology
*   Discuss topics relevant to becoming a successful scientist
*   Write a scientific research proposal

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

This course prepares students for a future in academia, specifically for success in graduate school in biophysics and/or physical biology.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 6 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture / Discussion
--------------------

*   Met once per week for 2 hours per session; 12 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   MIT faculty guest lecturers led discussions about scientific journal articles on topics in biophysics and/or physical biology.
*   Each class session included a discussion about a non-research topic, such as “Becoming a Scientist,” or “Writing a Fellowship Proposal.”

Out of Class
------------

*   Students read assigned readings about biophysics/physical biology topics and non-research discussion topics.
*   Before each class, students answered assigned reading questions.
